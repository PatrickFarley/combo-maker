You need to step in before elbows and knees and step out before regular strikes. Some can go either way, like you can step before a hook, or not. Stepping after kicks is easiest. 

* Track distance separately? And use a second matrix? Or just tack on additional rules \- that's easier. List the moves that cannot be done at x or y distance. Make it all optional.  
* Step in and step out cannot come after or before reset.  
* Optional rule to eliminate resets. If you turn this off and turn off spacing management, you'll have continual combos  
  * Turn off slips too and you'll have continual striking

The only move that can double up is the jab. Other moves need at least a reset before they repeat.

Can only slip after certain strikes.  
Can only roll after certain strikes.

A later implementation can store probability information instead of booleans. So instead of checking "true" it checks "is my randomly generated value less than the registered value". 

After a step-out, you can start up with either L or R.

I think almost anything can come after a teep
